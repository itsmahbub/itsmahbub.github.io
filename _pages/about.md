I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Texas A&M University, working under the guidance of [Dr. Nitesh Saxena](https://nsaxena.engr.tamu.edu/) at the [SPIES](https://spies.engr.tamu.edu/) research lab. My research focuses on AI Safety & Security and AI for Cybersecurity, spanning adversarial attacks and defense in AI systems, phishing and scam detection, and fuzzing-based frameworks for testing AI vulnerabilities.

With over five years of industry experience in cloud infrastructure and site reliability, I aim to bridge research and practice to advance trustworthy and robust AI systems.
