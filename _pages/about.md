I am [Mahbub Alam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alam-mahbub/), a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html). I am currently working under the guidance of [Dr. Nitesh Saxena](https://nsaxena.engr.tamu.edu/) at the [SPIES](https://spies.engr.tamu.edu/) research lab. My research focuses on the integration of cybersecurity with cognitive security, using neurophysiological data to enhance detection and response to cyber threats. I also explore AI-driven defenses against phishing and deepfake attacks.
